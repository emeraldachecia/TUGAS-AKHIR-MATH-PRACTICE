            <p>
                Math Practice is an interactive web-based platform designed to help
                students improve their understanding of <strong>arithmetic</strong> and
                <strong>geometry</strong> through structured exercises. Each question is
                generated dynamically based on difficulty level and topic, allowing
                students to sharpen their problem-solving skills at their own pace.
            </p>
            <p>
                The system supports both <strong>students</strong> and
                <strong>administrators</strong>: students can log in to access
                exercises, view progress, and track their learning history, while
                administrators can create question templates, manage users, and monitor
                performance reports.
